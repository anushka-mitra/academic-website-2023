  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper explores the role of noisy information in fluctuations as well as the slow recovery of the U.S. labor market from recessions. Utilizing a novel structural VAR model, this paper identifies noise shocks - expectational errors stemming from imperfect information— as a significant factor influencing key labor market indicators. These noise shock  cause firms and workers to misperciev the persistence of aggregate productivity, thereby affecting wages, job vacancies, job-finding rates, and ultimately, unemployment levels. Historical decomposition reveals that noise shocks contributed substantially to persistence of unemployment, vacancies, and sluggish job-finding rates during these recessions. These results motivate the introduction of imperfect information into a search and matching model, providing a more nuanced framework for understanding labor market dynamics. Quantitative analysis finds that imperfect information in presence of rigid wages contribute significantly to the sluggishness of the labor marker. Counterfactual analyses documents that without noise shocks, the labor market would recover 8-10 quarters sooner from the Great Recession. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the role of noisy information in macroeconomic models, as it can notably impact the aggregate dynamics of the labor market. </p>

  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper studies the role
  of imperfect information in propagating labor market fluctuations, where
  agents are rational and form beliefs about the fundamentals of the economy by
  observing noisy signals about the aggregate state in a stylized search and
  matching framework. Noise shocks to beliefs affects the hiring decision of the
  firms as well as search intensity of workers which in turn affects bargained
  wages causing further feedback effect via consumption demand on vacancy
  creation of firms, thus, ultimately affecting the aggregate labor market
  dynamics. Using the now cast errors of professional forecasters, I use a
  sign-restricted VAR to identify noise shocks from the fundamental shocks in
  the data. I show that these noise shocks have a significant and more
  persistent effect on unemployment, vacancies and job-finding rate in the data
  compared to fundamental shocks. Noise shocks can explain a significant
  fraction of the volatility in unemployment and vacancies, consistent with the
  model’s implications. </p>
