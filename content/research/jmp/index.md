  <p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">This paper assess role of imperfect information for fluctuations in the U.S. labor market, and especially for the persistence in the recoveries from recessions. Utilizing a novel structural VAR model, I identify noise shocks - expectational errors stemming from imperfect informationâ€” as a significant factor that drive labor market fluctuations. Due to imperfect information, firms and workers cannot immediately distinguish whether an aggregate productivity shock is persistent, transitory or noise which affects their behavior and hence aggregate outcomes. Counterfactual analyses documents that without noise shocks, the labor market would recover 4-8 quarters sooner from the post 90s recessions. Introduction of imperfect information in a search and matching model contributes 28% more to the persistence of unemployment after recessions relative to the full information benchmark. Imperfect information further generates 30% higher volatility in unemployment and vacancies, highlighting its importance in driving labor market dynamics </p>
