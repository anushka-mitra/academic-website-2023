  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper studies whether imperfect information about the persistence of underlying aggregate productivity shocks can explain the business cycle dynamics of the labor market, particularly the persistence of the unemployment rate. Utilizing a novel structural VAR model, I identify noise shocks - expectational errors stemming from imperfect information— as a significant factor that drives labor market dynamics. Due to this imperfect information, firms and workers face challenges in promptly discerning the nature of an aggregate productivity shock, be it persistent, transitory, or mere noise. This ambiguity impacts wages, job vacancies, job-finding rates, and, consequentially, overall unemployment levels. By introducing imperfect information into a general equilibrium search and matching model, I underscore its role in amplifying the persistence of unemployment rate. Counterfactual analysis illustrates that, in the absence of noise shocks, labor market recovery from post-1990s recessions would be expedited by 7-10 quarters, thus suggesting that imperfect information is an important mechanism for resolving the slow recovery puzzle in the U.S labor market. </p>

  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper studies the role
  of imperfect information in propagating labor market fluctuations, where
  agents are rational and form beliefs about the fundamentals of the economy by
  observing noisy signals about the aggregate state in a stylized search and
  matching framework. Noise shocks to beliefs affects the hiring decision of the
  firms as well as search intensity of workers which in turn affects bargained
  wages causing further feedback effect via consumption demand on vacancy
  creation of firms, thus, ultimately affecting the aggregate labor market
  dynamics. Using the now cast errors of professional forecasters, I use a
  sign-restricted VAR to identify noise shocks from the fundamental shocks in
  the data. I show that these noise shocks have a significant and more
  persistent effect on unemployment, vacancies and job-finding rate in the data
  compared to fundamental shocks. Noise shocks can explain a significant
  fraction of the volatility in unemployment and vacancies, consistent with the
  model’s implications. </p>
