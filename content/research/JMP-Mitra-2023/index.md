  <p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">I study the sources of slow recoveries in U.S. labor markets, where unemployment remains persistently high during the recoveries. Using a novel structural VAR, I show that noise shocks: expectational errors due to the noise in received signals, contribute significantly to the recent slow recoveries. I find that on average across recessions between 1968-2019, noise shocks account for 32% of the total duration to recover 50% of the rise in unemployment. Incorporating imperfect information about the underlying persistence of aggregate productivity shocks, which arise due to presence of noise shocks, in a standard general equilibrium search and matching model increases the persistence of unemployment relative to a full information benchmark through two channels. First, responses to productivity shocks are more persistent because agents are learning about whether a shock is persistent or not. Second, noise shocks provide an additional source of persistence in labor markets. </p>
