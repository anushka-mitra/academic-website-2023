<p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">Welcome to my webpage! I am a 6th year PhD candidate at the Department of Economics, The University of Texas at Austin.</p>

<p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">My research interest is in Macroeconomics, with a focus on Labor Markets. Specifically, I am interested in studying how the macroeocnomic sentimemts of labor market participants affect individual as well as aggregate labor market outcomes. You can read more about my research [here]({{< relref "/publication/_index.md" >}}) For more information, please contact me at <a href="anushka@utexas.edu">anushka@utexas.edu.</a></p>
