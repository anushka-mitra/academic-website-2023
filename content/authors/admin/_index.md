<p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">Welcome! I am a 6th year PhD candidate at the Department of Economics, The University of Texas at Austin. I am on the 2023-24 job market.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">My research interest is in Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. In my current research, I assess the role of information frictions in explaining labor market dynamics. For more information, please contact me at <a href="anushka@utexas.edu">anushka@utexas.edu</a>.</p>
