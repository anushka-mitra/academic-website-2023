<p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">Welcome! I am an Economist with the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/iftfs-staff.htm">Trade and Financial Studies</a> Section at the Federal Reserve Board. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from the <a href = "https://www.liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/">University of Texas at Austin</a> in Spring 2024. </p>


<p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">My research interest is in Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. In my current research, I assess the role of information frictions in explaining labor market dynamics. For more information, please contact me at <a href="anushka@utexas.edu">anushka@utexas.edu</a>.</p>
