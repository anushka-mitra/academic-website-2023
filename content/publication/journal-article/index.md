  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper uses daily data on
  household expectations to examine what causes households to adjust their
  expectations about the future of the economy. We analyze several macro
  variables of policy interest and find that households respond primarily to
  movements in the unemployment rate. Further, these responses are non-linear
  and asymmetric, with households displaying higher sensitivity to larger shocks
  and to negative information indicating a worsening of the economy. We also
  find heterogeneity across local labor markets: Households in areas with higher
  local unemployment are more sensitive to changes in national unemployment than
  those in areas with lower local unemployment. We further examine whether the
  media plays a role in influencing household expectations, and find that news
  about unemployment rises sharply during a recession, consistent with the
  response of expectations.</p>
