  This paper provides evidence using survey data from the Survey of Consumer
  Expectations that workers' expectations towards the economy and specifically
  the labor market have a significant impact on their search effort. Pessimistic
  workers who expect the labor market to do worse in the future significantly
  increase their current search intensity, while optimistic workers report a
  decrease. Using the 2016 US Presidential election as an exogenous shock to
  macroeconomic sentiments, I find that Republican states became optimistic
  immediately after the elections and reported a decline in search hours by 3.75
  hours/week relative to the Democrat states that became pessimistic about the
  economy. The paper evaluates the effect of an expansionary corporate tax cut
  policy by introducing workers with heterogeneous beliefs in a stylized search
  model with endogenous search effort. Presence of heterogeneous beliefs dampens
  the effect of such a policy on the unemployment rate by about 0.7 pp as
  compared to the model with homogeneous and unbiased beliefs.
