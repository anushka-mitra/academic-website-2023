title: Belief Shocks and Labor Market Dynamics
abstract: >
  This paper studies the role of imperfect information in propagating labor
  market fluctuations, where agents are rational and form beliefs about the
  fundamentals of the economy by observing noisy signals about the aggregate
  state in a stylized search and matching framework. Noise shocks to beliefs
  affects the hiring decision of the firms as well as search intensity of
  workers which in turn affects bargained wages causing further feedback effect
  via consumption demand on vacancy creation of firms, thus, ultimately
  affecting the aggregate labor market dynamics. Using the now cast errors of
  professional forecasters, I use a sign-restricted VAR to identify noise shocks
  from the fundamental shocks in the data. I show that these noise shocks have a
  significant and more persistent effect on unemployment, vacancies and
  job-finding rate in the data compared to fundamental shocks. Noise shocks can
  explain a significant fraction of the volatility in unemployment and
  vacancies, consistent with the modelâ€™s implications.
