  <p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">This paper explores the role of noisy information in fluctuations as well as the slow recovery of the U.S. labor market from recessions. Utilizing a novel structural VAR model, this paper identifies noise shocks - expectational errors stemming from imperfect informationâ€” as a significant factor influencing key labor market indicators. These noise shock  cause firms and workers to misperciev the persistence of aggregate productivity, thereby affecting wages, job vacancies, job-finding rates, and ultimately, unemployment levels. Historical decomposition reveals that noise shocks contributed substantially to persistence of unemployment, vacancies, and sluggish job-finding rates during these recessions. These results motivate the introduction of imperfect information into a search and matching model, providing a more nuanced framework for understanding labor market dynamics. Quantitative analysis finds that imperfect information in presence of rigid wages contribute significantly to the sluggishness of the labor marker. Counterfactual analyses documents that without noise shocks, the labor market would recover 8-10 quarters sooner from the Great Recession. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the role of noisy information in macroeconomic models, as it can notably impact the aggregate dynamics of the labor market. </p>
