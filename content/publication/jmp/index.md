  <p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond;text-align: justify;">This paper studies whether imperfect information about the persistence of underlying aggregate productivity shocks can explain the business cycle dynamics of the labor market, particularly the persistence of the unemployment rate. Utilizing a novel structural VAR model, I identify noise shocks - expectational errors stemming from imperfect informationâ€” as a significant factor that drives labor market dynamics. Due to this imperfect information, firms and workers face challenges in promptly discerning the nature of an aggregate productivity shock, be it persistent, transitory, or mere noise. This ambiguity impacts wages, job vacancies, job-finding rates, and, consequentially, overall unemployment levels. By introducing imperfect information into a general equilibrium search and matching model, I underscore its role in amplifying the persistence of unemployment rate. Counterfactual analysis illustrates that, in the absence of noise shocks, labor market recovery from post-1990s recessions would be expedited by 7-10 quarters, thus suggesting that imperfect information is an important mechanism for resolving the slow recovery puzzle in the U.S labor market. </p>
