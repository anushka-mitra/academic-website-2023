  <p style="font-family:rose;text-align: justify;">This paper studies the role
  of imperfect information in propagating labor market fluctuations, where
  agents are rational and form beliefs about the fundamentals of the economy by
  observing noisy signals about the aggregate state in a stylized search and
  matching framework. Noise shocks to beliefs affects the hiring decision of the
  firms as well as search intensity of workers which in turn affects bargained
  wages causing further feedback effect via consumption demand on vacancy
  creation of firms, thus, ultimately affecting the aggregate labor market
  dynamics. Using the now cast errors of professional forecasters, I use a
  sign-restricted VAR to identify noise shocks from the fundamental shocks in
  the data. I show that these noise shocks have a significant and more
  persistent effect on unemployment, vacancies and job-finding rate in the data
  compared to fundamental shocks. Noise shocks can explain a significant
  fraction of the volatility in unemployment and vacancies, consistent with the
  modelâ€™s implications. </p>
